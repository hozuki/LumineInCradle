A collection of simple mods for [Alice in Cradle](https://fantia.jp/fanclubs/24531).

The mods uses [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) 5 as mod framework.

To use the mods:

1. Extract BepInEx base files in the game directory.
2. Place mod DLLs into somewhere in `BepInEx/plugins` directory.

Mods target game version 0.20s.

## Development

Requirements:

- .NET 6 SDK with C# 10
- workload of .NET Framework development (targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1)

Select Unity Modules 2020.3.25(f1) as dependencies.

## Projects

### Common

Common classes.

### Always0721

**EVIL**

Force enabling a menu item so that something bad (or good, depending on your point of view) will happen.

### EggHarvest

**EVIL**

Well since the logic is simply not bound (except in the restroom, and the code there is heavily tangled),
the only effect of this plugin is lighting up those menu items.

### IronBarrier

**GOOD**

> *Thops's Barrier*
>
> The lifelong pursuit of Thops the Bluntstone.
>
> Creates a magic forcefield that deflects sorceries and incantations.
> Hold to continuously create barriers.
>
> Future generations will learn. They will know the foolishness of
> the sneering sorcerers who ridiculed this theory, little realizing
> that it was in fact a discovery worthy of a new conspectus of the
> academy.

This one does not deflect sorceries though. You still need to fight bravely. The thing it deflects
is of greater evil.

### NoMosaic

**EVIL**

You know what it is.

It does NOT de-mosaic if the image is painted with mosaic.

### VerticalSync

**NEUTRAL**

Enable vertical sync to end the suffering of torn graphics.

## Remarks

The game is of very good quality. I suggest you not to cheat. You need to practice yourself until you are
familiar  with the game's mechanisms. Just treat it as another Souls-like game. And that is why I will not
create mods to lower battle difficulty. Long may the sun shine.

Due to possible code changes, mods may or may not work when the game updates.
Maybe I will update the mods accordingly, but probably I will not.
